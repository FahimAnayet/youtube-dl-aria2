# Youtube-dl + Aria2 ðŸ˜‰

This is a **Shell Script** I've created to easily use youtube-dl and aria2 simple use.

- **Make Sure you have youtube-dl and aria2**
**Make Sure you add this file in your path**

## Commands

"yt link" will show you the video and audio id, or If this is a m3u3 file (hls) then it will start downloading immediately and faster!

"yt video-id audio-id link number-of-splites" will use aria2 and youtube-dl to download and merge the file.

"yt video-id or audio-id link number-of-splites" will use aria2 and youtube-dl to download only video or audio.

That's it.

*_Enjoy_*
